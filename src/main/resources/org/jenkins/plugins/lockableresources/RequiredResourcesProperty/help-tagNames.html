        Rather than explicitly listing desired resources, it is possible to specify
        a list of tags that map to globally configured resources.  The plugin will attempt to
        lock resources that have matching tags.  Tags should be space delimited.
    </p>

        Note there is an implicit 'AND' between tags, only resources that have ALL tags will be
        considered for locking.
